/**
 * A {@code RadiusProximity} elaborates any agents contained in the specified list that are within the radius of the owner.
 * <p>
 * Note that this implementation checks the AI time of the current frame through the {@link Timepiece#getTime()
 * GdxAI.getTimepiece().getTime()} method in order to calculate neighbors only once per frame (assuming delta time is always
 * greater than 0, if time has changed the frame has changed too). This means that
 * <ul>
 * <li>if you forget to {@link Timepiece#update(float) update the timepiece} on each frame the proximity instance will be
 * calculated only the very first time, which is not what you want of course.</li>
 * <li>ideally the timepiece should be updated before the proximity is updated by the {@link #findNeighbors(ProximityCallback)}
 * method.</li>
 * </ul>
